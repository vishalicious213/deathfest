# Deathfest splash page

This is a customization of the second project in Scrimba's Module 6 (Responsive Design). The original design was a product splash page for "Scrimbafy". I've converted it into a signup page for the 2024 Maryland Deathfest. Some of the concepts that were used to build this project included transforming text, viewport units, Flexbox order, modifier classes and box-sizing. My customizations added CSS variables and responsive font sizes using `calc()`.
